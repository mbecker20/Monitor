# Monitor CLI

Monitor CLI is a tool to sync monitor resources and execute operations.

## Install

```sh
cargo install monitor_cli
```

## Usage

### Credentials

Configure a file `~/.config/monitor/creds.toml` file with contents:
```toml
url = "https://your.monitor.address"
key = "YOUR-API-KEY"
secret = "YOUR-API-SECRET"
```

Note. You can specify a different creds file by using `--creds ./other/path.toml`.
You can also bypass using any file and pass the information using `--url`, `--key`, `--secret`:

```sh
monitor --url "https://your.monitor.address" --key "YOUR-API-KEY" --secret "YOUR-API-SECRET" ...
```

### Run Executions

```sh
# Triggers an example build
monitor execute run-build test_build
```
