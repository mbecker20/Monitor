# Monitor Resources

Entities like `Server`, `Deployment`, and `Build` all fall under the `Resource` abstraction.

All resources have common traits, such as a unique `name` and `id` amongst all other resources of the same resource type.
All resources can be assigned `tags`, which can be used to group related resources across resouce types.

Here is a list of the resources and what they do:

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';

<DocCardList />
```
