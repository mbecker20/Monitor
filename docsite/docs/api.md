# API

Komodo Core exposes an http API to read data, write configuration, and execute actions. The API documentation is generated from the code and is [available here](https://docs.rs/komodo_client/latest/komodo_client/api/index.html).

You can also install the [Komodo CLI](https://crates.io/crates/komodo_cli) to execute actions like RunBuild or DeployStack from the command line.
This can be coupled with scripts in Komodo Repos to achieve unlimited automation.
