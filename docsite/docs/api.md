# API

Monitor Core exposes an http API to read data, write configuration, and execute actions. The API documentation is generated from the code and is [available here](https://docs.rs/monitor_client/latest/monitor_client/api/index.html).

You can also install the [Monitor CLI](https://crates.io/crates/monitor_cli) to execute actions like RunBuild or DeployStack from the command line.
This can be coupled with scripts in Monitor Repos to achieve unlimited automation.
