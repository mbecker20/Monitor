# Configuring Webhooks

Multiple Komodo resources can take advantage of webhooks from your git provider. Komodo supports incoming webhooks using the Github standard, which is also supported by other providers like Gitea.

:::note
On Gitea, the default "Gitea" webhook type works with the Github standard üëç

## Copy the Resource Payload URL

Find the resource in UI, like a `Build`, `Repo`, or `Stack`.
Scroll down to the bottom of Configuration area, and copy the webhook for the action you want.

## Create the webhook on the Git Provider

Navigate to the repo page on your git provider, and go to the settings for the Repo.
Find Webhook settings, and click to create a new webhook.

You will have to input some information. 

1. The `Payload URL` is the link that you copied in the step above, `Copy the Resource Payload URL`.
2. For Content-type, choose `application/json`
3. For Secret, input the secret you configured in the Komodo Core config (`KOMODO_WEBHOOK_SECRET`).
4. Enable SSL Verification, if you have proper TLS setup to your git provider (recommended).
5. For "events that trigger the webhook", just the push request is what post people want.
6. Of course, make sure the webhook is "Active" and hit create.

## When does it trigger?

Your git provider will now push this webhook to Komodo on *every* push to *any* branch. However, your `Build`, `Repo`,
etc. only cares about a specific branch of the repo.

Because of this, the webhook will trigger the action **only on pushes to the branch configured on the resource**.

For example, if I make a build, I may point the build to the `release` branch of a particular repo. If I set up a webhook, and push to the `main` branch, the action will *not trigger*. It will only trigger when the push is to the `release` branch.

## Procedure webhooks

Not all actions support webhooks directly, however for those that don't, they can still be triggered via webhook by using a Procedure. Just create a Procedure and configure it to run the action you are looking for, and create a webhook pointing to the Procedure.

Since Procedures don't specificy a particular branch it should listen for pushes on, this information
must be put in the webhook payload url. Procedures use webhook payload urls of the form:

```
<KOMODO_HOST>/listener/github/procedure/<PROCEDURE_ID>/<LISTEN_BRANCH>
```

If the `<LISTEN_BRANCH>` is not provided, it will default to listening on the `main` branch.
