# Setup Komodo

To run Komodo, you will need Docker. See [the docker install docs](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

### Deploy with Docker Compose

- [Using MongoDB](./mongo.mdx)
- [Using Postgres](./postgres.mdx)
- [Using Sqlite](./sqlite.mdx)

:::info
Komodo is able to support Postgres and Sqlite by utilizing the [FerretDB Mongo Adapter](https://www.ferretdb.com/).
If that makes you happy, drop them a [star ⭐️](https://github.com/FerretDB/FerretDB).
