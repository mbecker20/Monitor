# Setup Komodo

To run Komodo, you will need Docker. See [the docker install docs](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

### Deploy with Docker Compose

- [Using MongoDB](./mongo.mdx)
- [Using Postgres](./postgres.mdx)
- [Using Sqlite](./sqlite.mdx)

:::info
Komodo is able to support Postgres and Sqlite by utilizing the [FerretDB Mongo Adapter](https://www.ferretdb.com/).
If that makes you happy, drop them a [star ⭐️](https://github.com/FerretDB/FerretDB).

### First login

Core should now be accessible on the specified port, so navigating to `http://<address>:<port>` will display the login page.

The first user to log in will be auto enabled and made an admin. Any additional users to create accounts will be disabled by default, and must be enabled by an admin.

### Https

Komodo Core only supports http, so a reverse proxy like [caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) should be used for https.
